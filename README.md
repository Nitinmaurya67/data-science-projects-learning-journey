# Learning via Projects — Data Science Journey

This repository documents my hands-on learning approach to data science through real-world projects.  
Instead of learning theory first, I focus on building practical projects to master concepts like:

✅ **Feature Extraction** — turning raw data into meaningful inputs  
✅ **Data Visualization** — communicating insights with charts and plots  
✅ **Data Capstone Projects** — end-to-end workflows from data cleaning to reporting  

Each project folder includes:
- 📂 Dataset source
- 🧠 Problem statement
- 🛠️ Implementation (Python / Pandas / NumPy / Matplotlib / etc.)
- 📊 Key insights & visualizations

## 🚀 Goal

To learn by doing — and build a strong portfolio in the process.
